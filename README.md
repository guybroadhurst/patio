## General info
This was the second project on the [Superhi Foundation](https://superhi.com/courses/html-css-javascript-foundation) course. It comprises of a single column website for a cafe in London. Beyond the original scope of the tutorial I added further pages and expanded the complexity of the site. This was a good extension of the knowledge I had already gained from the previous projects on the course, and was a more in depth look into media queries.
